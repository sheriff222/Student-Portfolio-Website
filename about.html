                <p class="first">Hi, my name is **Hassan Sheriff**, and I am presently studying hard to attain a **Diploma in Computer Science**. 
                This study is being undertaken at the renowned 
                **University of Management and Technology (UNIMTECH)**, which is located 
                in the cosmopolitan city of Freetown, Sierra Leone.
    </p>
    
    <p class="second"> Technology has never been to me merely a subject of academic pursuit; it is a canvas 
    upon which I can showcase my creativity, work on significant real-world problems,
     and positively contribute to society in a meaningful way. I feel that excellent developers 
     are not merely individuals who code; they are the characters of thoughtful creators, 
     ingenious designers, and inspiring leaders.

        **Scholarship and Development**
        I'm in **Year 2** of my diploma, with good academic records, and being actively involved in projects and organizations that push me to develop further. I'm a backend and full-stack developer with increasing expertise in Java, Python, and recent web technologies. My studies have established a solid background in algorithms, system design, and data structures.
        
    </p>
    
    <p class="forth">
        **The Individual I Am Beyond the Code Lines**
    Outside coding, I'm a perpetual learner who sustains on creativity and meaningful storytelling. I enjoy watching movies (especially those that spark imagination), reading inspirational and technical books, and mentoring young students who are new to the world of computing.
    
    I am a strong believer in **tech with purpose**.
