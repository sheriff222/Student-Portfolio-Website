            <h2>Library Management System</h2>
            <p>*Technologies used:* Java, MySQL, NetBeans
*Position:* Team Leader and Principal Software Engineer
*Year:* 2024

Developed a desktop application for the management of library activities like book inventory, lending, registration of users, and reminder of overdue books. It includes a secure log in option, database-based search option, and administrative options.
**Impact:** Contributed considerably towards facilitating the simulation and modeling of the operation of real-world libraries, which helps to provide meaningful academic training as well as to ease the process of institutional automation.

This particular project was the most challenging solo task I have ever had to complete. It significantly deepened my understanding of the intricate relationship of Java and SQL integration, while simultaneously teaching me to think like a system architect when it comes to issues.
